# 365 days of self discipline

1. Life's easy when you live the it hard way... and hard when you try to live it the easy way - _Dave Kekich_

2. Your choices are made in a moment , but their consquences will transcend a lifetime - _M J DeMarco_

3. Willpower is what separates us from the animals. It's the capacity to restrain our impulses, resist temptation - do what's right and good for us in the long run, not what we want to do right now. It's central, in fact, to civilisation. - _Roy Baumeister_

4. I love self-dscipline, but creating systmes that make it next to impossible to misbehave is more reliable than self-control
