## Web design and website personalities

Note the difference between web designers and developers

> Web designers make the design of the site [fonts, layout, btns, etc] using a sketching app or anything
> Developers take the design and write code to reproduce it
> You can and should be able to design and develop

#### Take design seriously

- To create an immediate & lasting good impression
- Increase trust in the brand and the percieved value
- Give user what they need | User experience

## Guidelines / Rules / Framework

> **Everyone can learn designing by following a framework/sytem of guidelines**
> good design is not subject or creative

### Ingredients / Concepts in design

_These determine the website personalities_

1. Typography
2. Colors
3. Image/Illustrations
4. Iocns
5. Shadows
6. Border-radius
7. White space
8. Visual hierarchy
9. User experence
10. Components / Layouts

### Personalities

1. Serious/Elegant

- for luxury and elegance. Based of thin serif typefaces, golden or pastel colors & big hd images eg. [TheGoldenCenterAppartments]

2. Minimalist/Simple

- focus on essential text content, using small or medium-sized sans-serif black text, lines. Few images and icons e.g. [Onplace]

3. Plain/Neutral

- design gets out of the way. Use of neutral & small typefaces, and a very structured layout. Common to big coorporations eg. [microsoft]

4. Bold/Confident

- Make an impact. Features big bold typography, paired with confident use of big bright blocks eg. [endplan]

5. Calm/Peaceful

- products that transmit care. Calming pastel colors, soft serif headings, matching illustrations eg. [octave]

6. Startup/Upbeat

- widely used in startups. features medium-sized sans-serif typefaces, light-grey text n bgs, & rounded elements eg. [capsule]

7. Playful/Fun

- Colorful and rounded designs. Creative elements like hand-drawn icons, illustrations, animations, fun language eg. [KhanAcademy]

## 1. Typography

**Making text readable, legible and appealing**

> Serif typeface

    # has small detals, tails at end of lines (aka serifs)
    # creates a traditional/classic look & feel
    # good for long text: magazines, articles, news

> Sans-serif

    # Donot have decorative serifs
    # look clean and simple: Modern look & feel

### 1. Good Typefaces

Use popular typefaces to play safe

> [GoogleFonts] > [FontSquirrel]

> Sans-serif

    - Inter
    - Open Sans
    - Roboto
    - Montserrat
    - Work Sans
    - Lato

> Serif

    - Merriweather
    - Aleo
    - Playfar Display
    - Cormrant
    - Cardo
    - Lora

> experiment with the different fonts available on the sites provided

- Use just one typeface per page. Atmost use two

- Choose the typeface according to the sites personality

### 2. Font sizes and weights

- When choosing, limit choices. Use a typescale tool or predefined range like [type-scale](type-scale.com)
- **Normal text**: use fontsize btn 16px & 32px
- **Long text**: try a size >=20px
- **headlines**: You can go big (50px+) and blod(600+) depending on personality
- Don't go below 400(regular weight)

- #### Good reading experience

  - Use less than 75 xters per line
  - Normal sized text, use line height btn 1.5 and 2. For big text go below 1.5

    > The smaller or longer the text, the larger the line height needs to be

  - Donot use over sized line-heights, which make lines look detached
  - Decrease letter spacing in headlines, if it looks unnatural (From experience)
  - All caps for short titles, make em small n bold and decrease letter spacing
  - Don't justfy text usually
  - Don't center long text blocks. Small blocks are fine

    - These are not strics rules. Just guidlines :D

## 2. Colors

1. The main color should match your website's personality::colors convey meaning

- Color meanings
  - Red: draws attention, symbolise power, passion, excitement
  - Orange: less aggressive, conveys happiness, cheerfulness, creativity
  - Yellow: means joy, brightness, intelligence
  - Green: harmony, nature, growth, health
  - Blue: assoc. with peace, trust, professionalism
  - Purple: conveys wealth, wisdom, magic
  - Pink: romance, care, affection
  - Brown: nature, durability, comfort
  - Black: power, elegance & minimalism, but also grief and sorrow

2. Use a good color tone. Don't choose random tone or CSS-named colors

- Resources include [OpenColor], [tailwindcss], [FlatUIColors2]

3. Color system

   > 1. You need atleast two colors in your color palette: a main and a grey color
   > 2. With experience, you can add more colors: accent colors _use a tool_
   > 3. Create lighter and darker versions (tints and shades)
   >    _use a tool like (palleton.com), [Coolors], [Tint and shade generator]_

4. Use the main color to draw attention to the most importnat elements on the page
5. Use colors to add interesting accents or make entire components or sections stand out
6. If possible, Use colors strategically in images and illustrastions

7. Colors and typography
   > 1. On dark colored bgs, try to use a tint of the bg (lighter version) for text
   > 2. Text should usually not be completely black. Lighten up if it looks heavy.
   > 3. Don't make text too light. For accessibility reasons.

## 3. Images & illustrations

1. There r dfft types of images: product photos,stoy telling photos (images talk about the product or site), illustrations(2D or 3D), patterns(Bgs, sections, or behind images/forms/btns)

2. Use images to support the sites message and story. Only use relevant images

3. Prefer original images. if not possible, use original looking stock images. use sites [Unsplash], [Pexels], [DrawKit], [unDraw]

- How to use images well

4. Try to show real people to trigger user's emotions

5. If necessary, crop images to fit the message

6. Experiment combining photos, illustrations and patterns

- Handling text on images

7. Method#1: Darken or brighten images (completely or partially using a gradient)
8. Method#2: Position text into neutral image area
9. Method#3: Put text in a box

10. To account for high resolution screens, make image dimensions **2x as big** as their displayed size
11. Compress images for a lower file size and better perfomance. Use a tool like [Sqoosh]
12. When using multple images side by side, make sure they have the exact dimensions.

## 4. Icons

1. Use a good icon pack. There are tons of free and paid icons

- Resources: [Phosphor icons], **[ioncons]**, [icons], **[uiicons]**

2. Use only one icon pack. Don't mix icons from sources

3. Use svg icons or icon fonts. Don't use bitmap formats (.jpg, .png)

4. Adjust to website personality! Roundness, weight, filled/oultined depend on typography

5. Use icons to provide visual assistance to text
6. Use icons for product feature blocks
7. Use icons associated with actions, and label them (unless no space or icon is 100% clear) eg. [twitter], [Chess.com] and many web applications

8. Use icons as bullet points

9. Use same color for icons as the text to keep them neutral. A diiferent draws more attention though
10. Don't confuse users with icons that make no sense, and don't fit the text **!!Many sites are guilty of this**
11. Don't make icons larger than their intended use. If needed, enclose them in a shape (circle or sqaure)

## 5. Shadows

- Shadows create depth (3D). The more the shadow,the further away from the interface the element is
- They create visual heirarchy

1. You don't have to use shadows! Only use them if it makes sense to the website
2. Use them in small doses, don't add shadows everywhere
3. Go light on shadows, don't make them too dark. **This is an easy to ruin your design**
4. Use small shadows for small elements that should stand out(draw attention)
5. Use medium sizedshadows for larger areas that should stand out a bit more
6. Use larger shadows for elements that should float above the interface
7. Experiment changing shadows on mouse interaction (click and hover)
8. Note glows i.e colored shadows

```css
.selector {
  box-shadow: <hor offset (btn box and shadow) > <vert offset> <shadow blur
    (how far the shadow goes) > <shadow scaling | optional> <shadow color>;

  text-shadow: <x-offset> <y-offset> <blur> <color>;
}
```

_Check out documentaion on how the shadow properties work and how to hack them_
_Multiple shadows are separated by a comma_

**\*Note**

> Conside using shadows instead of borders for a cleaner design

## 6. Border radius

1. Use border-adius to increase the playfulness and fun of the design, to make it less serious
2. Typeface have a certain roundness: make sure that border-radius matches that roundness
3. Use border-radius on buttons, images, around icons, standout sections, etc

## 7. Whitesapce

- The right amount of whitespace makes designs look clean, modern and polished
- It creates invisible relationshiips btn the elements of a layout. Enables us to distinguish btn sections and elements

1. Use tons of whitespace btn sections
2. Use alot of whitespace btn groups of elements
3. Use white space btn elements
4. Inside groups of elements, try to use whitespace instead of lines
5. **The law of proximity. The more els belong together, the closer they should be**
6. Start with alot of whitespace(even too much), then remove whitespae as you proceed
7. Match other design choices. If there r big text or big icons, you need more whitspace
8. Try a hard rule, such as mulitples of 16px for all spacing

## 8. Visual Hierarchy

- establishng which elements are the most important ones
- Drawing attention to most important els
- About defining a path for users(eyes), to guide them intutively through the page
- We use a combination of position, size, colors, spacing, borders, m shadows

1. Position important els closer to the top of the page (attention flows from top to bottom)
2. Use images midfully. They draw alot of attention (larger ones draw more attention)
3. Whtespace creates separation. Use it strategically to emphasize elements.

- On text els

4. Use font size, font-weight, color, whitespace to convey importance
5. Emphasize titles, sub titles, links, buttons, data points, icons. De-emphasize less important text.

- Between components

6. Emphasize an important component using background color, shadow or border (or multiple)
7. You can also emphasze a component by de-emphasizng another component
8. Emphasize Testimonials, call-to-action, highlight sections, preview acrds, forms, pricing tables, important rows/columns in tables, etc etc

## 9. UX(User experience) design

- > Design is not just what it looks and feels like. Design is how it works. - Steve Jobs
- Looks/feels like = UI design
- How it works = UX design
- UX design can't exist without UI design. A good UI design requires good UX design.
- **The goal is align the users goals with business goals** ::the website/appliaction exists for a reason.

#### UX rules for usability

1. Don't design complicated layouts. Don't reinvent the wheel. Use patterns users know.
2. Make your call-to-action the most prominent elements, and make the text descriptive
3. Use blue text and underlined text only for links
4. Animations should have a purpose and be fast (btn 200ms & 500ms)
5. In forms, align lables and fields in a ssingle verticale line, to make the form easy to scan
6. Offer users good feedback for all actions: forms errors, form sucess, etcc [web apps]
7. **The Law of locality**: Place action buttons where they will create an effect in web apps. eg. Imagine a submit button button at the top corner of a form, instead of the bottom center where it will have an effect for the user after filling the form

### UX rules for page content

8. Use a descriptive, keyword-focused headline on your main page. Don't be vague or fancy
9. Only include relevant information, efficiently! Cut out fluff and make content 100% clear
10. Use simple words! Avod technical jargon and smart-sounding words
11. Break up long text wth sub-heading, images, block quotes, bullet points, etc

## Missing piece

**Steal like an artist**
**Getting inspired**

- Taking the good ideas form well designed sites without copying entire sections.
- Sources of inspirations: [land-book.com], [onepagelove.com], [awwards.com], [screenlane.com]
- Get creative ideas to get a general mindset into what is being designed

> When designing/styling a component, focus on layout and visual styles independently
> That is, start with visual styles(color, size, shadows, borders) then go to Layout
