## 1. Define

Define

- WHAT the webste is for

> About defining the business and user goals.
> Don't complicate the step

- Define the target audience. eg, Women, 24 - 60 years, Africans, etc

## 2. Plan

Start thinking about the website

> Should be based on business goals, user goals, target audence defined earlier

- Plan & gather content of the site: text, images, etc
- Usually provided by client, but you can help them to produce and find the content
- Plan the site map: what pages the site needs, how they are related to each other
- Based on content, plan the sections eah page needs to convey the content's message n in which order

> Don't come up with a pretty design n a nice web, then ultimately fill it with content.
> It should be the opposite: the content guides the design
> Define the website personality

## 3. Sketch

- Think about components and page layout patterns.
  > Get inspiration from different sources
- Get ideas in your head, sketch them on a paper or a design software (Eg. figma)
- Keep it simple, even if there's no detals & no text
- Draw boxes, just to get the idea out of your head

> This is an iterative process: experiment with different components, n over again, until you reach a conclusive design. You can still change these while coding as well
> Don't spend alot of time, don't try to make the sketch perfect

## 4. Design & build
